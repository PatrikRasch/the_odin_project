<p><h2> Description - how to make! </h2></p>
Have a bite at this 100% vegetarian meal that replaces chicken for cauliflower and chickpeas! I was truly sceptical the first time I threw this one into the pan, but it has turned out to become a household favorite - at least for me ;)


<p> <h3> Ingredients </h3> </p>
<ul>
    <li> One large cauliflower </li>
    <li> Roughly 200g chickpeas </li>
    <li> One ready to cook indian chicken tika pack (maybe only available in Norway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯) </li>
    <li> 1.5dl creme fraiche </li>
    <li> Olive oil </li>
</ul>

<p> <h3> Steps </h3> </p>
<ol>
    <li> Cut the cauliflower into appropriately small pieces (should be easy to eat) </li>
    <li> Drench the chickpeas </li>
    <li> Add the chickpeas, cauliflower and some oil into a pan </li>
    <li> Add in the "marinade" bag and mix thoroughly </li>
    <li> Let sit for 10 minutes to marinade </li>
    <li> Meanwhile, cook the rice that came with the ready-to-cook pack </li>
    <li> Start frying the chickpeas and cauliflower on a medium-high heat </li>
    <li> Meanwhile, add 3dl of water, 1.5dl of creme fraiche and the "saus" bag that came with the ready-to-cook pack into a pot </li>
    <li> Mix thoroughly and heat up until boiling. Let boil for 4 minutes, stir throughout </li>
    <li> Add the newly cooked sauce into the properly fried pan of chickpeas and cauliflower </li>
    <li> Let cook for another few minutes </li>
    <li> Serve the rice onto a plate alongside the chickpeas and cauliflower and voila, <strong>enjoy!</strong> </li>
</ol>
